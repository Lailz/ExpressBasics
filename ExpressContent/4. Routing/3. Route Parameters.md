Route parameters are named URL segments. We use them to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. To create a route parameter in a URL, we add a colon followed with the name of your parameter.

Let's take the following example: Assuming that we have an array of cake objects, and a request was sent to the following URL: `/cakes/3`. The response to this request is the cake object with the ID 3. The `3` can be any other ID. To access the cake with the ID `3` we will do the following:

```javascript
const cakes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Triple Chocolate Cake"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Marble Cake"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Pumpkin Cake"
  }
];

app.get("/cakes/:cakeId", (req, res) => {
  const { cakeId } = req.params;
  const cake = cakes.find(_cake => _cake.id === +cakeId);
  res.json(cake);
});
```

In this case we called our route parameter `cakeId`. So, the value (ID in this case) passed through the URL is saved inside `req.params.cakeId`.

We then compare the `cakeId` value to the IDs in the `cakes` array to fetch the `cake` object with the same ID through the `find` method. Finally we return the found cake as a JSON object.

This is what the response will look like in your browser:
