### What is Routing?

Routing is determining how the application responds to the request coming from the client. This request comes through a url endpoint and an HTTP method (such as `GET`, `POST`, etc.)

A route's syntax looks like this:

```javascript
app.method(routePath, someHandler);
```

- `app` is the instance of our express application.
- `method` represents the HTTP method of the route, such as `get`, `post`, etc.
- `routePath` is the path on the server. It defines the endpoints at which requests can be made.
- `someHandler` is a callback function that will be executed when the client sends a request to this route.
