![Express Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/Jb1tjbR.png)

How does Express work?
As shown in the diagram above, `Express` does the following:

1. The routes receives a request from the frontend.
2. It communicates with `Sequelize` if it needs to save new data to the database or if it wants to fetch data from the database.
3. The routes sends a response back to the frontend.
