To run our `express` app, we run the command `nodemon` followed by the name of the file we want to run.

To run our application using `yarn start` we will write a script in our `package.json` we will add a `scripts` property which takes an object as a value. Every property in this object is a script, the key is the command that will trigger this script and the value is the command we want to execute.

```json
{
  "name": "test-project",
  ...,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  }
}
```

The options are endless with scripting. To read more about it, [click here](https://medium.com/better-programming/write-your-first-shell-script-with-node-js-c612da65b1e1).
