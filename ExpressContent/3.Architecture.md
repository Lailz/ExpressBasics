As we can see in the image above, our backend uses the following:

- `Express`: for sending and receiving data from the frontend.
- `Sequelize`: for communicating with the database.
- `PostgreSQL`: which is our database.

We can summarize the backend process with the following:

1. `Express` receives a request from the frontend.
2. It passes commands to `Sequelize` to communicate with the database.
3. `Express` sends back a response to the frontend with a status message.
