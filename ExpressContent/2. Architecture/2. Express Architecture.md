![Express Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/Jb1tjbR.png)

As shown in the diagram above, `Express` does the following:

1. It receives a request from the frontend through the routes.
2. It communicates with `Sequelize` if it needs to save new data to the database or if it wants to fetch data from the database.
3. It returns a response to the frontend.
