### ERROR MIDDLEWARE

One of the common uses of middleware methods is error middleware methods, which is basically a function that we call if we have an error.

Here is an example for an error middleware:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log("ONE");
  next();
});
```

It looks like a normal middleware but the difference is that it has an extra parameter in the beginning, which is the error object.

To call the error middleware, you pass `next()` an object. When you do that, `Express` will directly go to the next method with four arguments.
