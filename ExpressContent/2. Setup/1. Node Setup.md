## GLOBAL SETUP

- Install node and yarn

### Node Setup

The first step is to create a folder using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. Then, we'll `cd` inside our folder.

`Express` is based on `node`, so we need a `node` environment to use `Express`. To create a `node` environment we use the following command inside our project folder:

```shell
    yarn init -y
```

The `-y` will set the default options such as the name of the project and version.

Note that your folder was empty, but after running the command above, we now have a `package.json` file. This file contains project-relevant data such as the name of the project, its description, the dependencies used in the project, etc. `yarn` uses this information to identify the project and handle the dependencies.

Next, create a file called `app.js` in your project folder. Open the `package.json` file and change the `main` property value to `app.js` as shown below:

```javascript
  "main": "app.js",
```

Now `node` knows that our main file is `app.js`.

Your `node` environment is ready.
