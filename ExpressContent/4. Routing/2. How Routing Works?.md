Basically, `Express` **listens** for `requests` that matches the `route` and `HTTP method`, and executes their callback function.

Let's take the following example:

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello World" });
});
```

This route will handle a `GET` request, and the callback function will be executed when the client requests the path `/` with a `GET` method.

The callback function takes two arguments, the request and response objects.

The response has many methods that sends a response back to the client. Those methods terminate the function execution, if no method was called the client request will be hanging. This route uses the `res.json()` to return a `json` object as a response.

Let's take another example. Assuming that we have an array of cake objects, and a request was sent to fetch this list.

```javascript
const cakes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Triple Chocolate Cake"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Marble Cake"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Pumpkin Cake"
  }
];

app.get("/cakes", (req, res) => res.json(cakes));
```

Since the request wants to **fetch** data, the method will be `get`. We called the URL `/cakes` and the we will pass the array of cakes to the `res.json` method.

This is what the response will look like in your browser:
