The web is a cycle of requests and responses between the clients and servers.

The client sends a `request` to the server which will reply with a `response`.

Let's take an example: Your web browser is the client, and you googled “Coded”. A `request` will be sent to Google’s servers and it will respond with the search results page which is the `response`.

**Requests**
Every request has a method and an endpoint. An endpoint is the location of the data in the server from which you request the resource. It's represented as a URL.

The method is the action that the client is asking the server to do. The most common methods are `GET` and `POST`. Let's take the following examples:

- `GET`: is used to ask the server to give something back, a webpage or some data. For example, when requesting `joincoded.com` we will receive joincoded`s website.
- `POST`: is used to send data to the server. For example, the username and password of a user who wants to login to their account.

**Responses**
If the response is successful, the body will be the requested data.

Every response has a status code, which represents the status of the response, whether it was successful or not.

Let's take the following status codes:

- 200 - OK : the request was successful
- 404 - Not Found : the requested endpoint does not exist
