### Nodemon

You might've noticed that to see any change that we're making to our code, we need to restart our server. To solve this issue, we will install `nodemon`.

`nodemon` is basically a wrapper for node, it runs node but includes a watch command that watches for changes to the application code and then restarts the server when changes are made.

To install it globally, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
yarn global add nodemon
```

Then to run your app using `nodemon`, run the following command inside your project folder:

```shell
nodemon app.js
```
