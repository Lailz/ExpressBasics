## Route Parameters

Route parameters are named URL segments. We use them to capture the values specified at their position in the URL.

Let's take the following example, we have the following URL: "/books/55" that fetches the book with the id 55. The `55` can be any other id. To access the `55` and find the book with this id we weill do the following:

```javascript
app.get("/books/:bookId", (req, res) => {
  const bookId = req.params.bookId;
  res.json({ "Book ID": bookId });
});
```

In our path, the colon indicates that what's following is a route parameter. The parameter is saved in `req.params`.

Let's make this more interesting! Assuming that we have an array of cake objects, we will look for the cake that has the id passed in the route parameter and return it as a `json` response.

```javascript
const cakes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    cakeName: "Triple Chocolate Cake"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    cakeName: "Victoria Cake"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    cakeName: "Pumpkin Cake"
  }
];

app.get("/cakes/:cakeId", (req, res) => {
  const { cakeId } = req.params;
  const cake = cakes.find(_cake => _cake.id === cakeId);
  res.json(cake);
});
```
