## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open source server environment that uses JavaScript on the server. It uses asynchronous programming which makes it fast.

## Why Node.js?

- **Asynchronous and Event Driven** this basically means that Node.js based servers for an API to return data. It moves to the next task directly.

- **Very Fast** Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, which makes it very fast in code execution.

- **No Buffering** Node.js applications never buffer any data, they simply output the data in chunks.
