Basically, `Express` **listens** for `requests` that matches the `route` and `HTTP method`, and executes their callback function.

Let's take the following example:

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.json({ message: "Hello World" }));
```

This route will handle a `GET` request, and the callback function will be executed when the client requests the path `/` with a `GET` method.

The callback function takes two arguments, the request and response objects.

The response has many methods that sends a response back to the client. This route uses the `res.json()` to return a `json` object as a response.
